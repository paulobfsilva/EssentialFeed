# EssentialFeed

This is the EssentialFeed repo for the iOSEssentialDeveloper course. In the first module, there was Planning, the Initial System design and the requirements analysis. 
This is a macOS framework for now, as we don't need UIKit for this module. This will be a monolith, as we only need to implement the FeedFeature interface, which will be implemented by the concrete classes Remote, Local, RemoteWithLocalFallback, and so on.
